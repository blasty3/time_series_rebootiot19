# SPOT (Streaming Peaks-Over-Threshold)

## INTRODUCTION
This folder contains a python3 file, a license file and several datasets on whch we can run SPOT and its variants.
The python file spot.py contains 4 classes : SPOT, DSPOT, biSPOT and biDSPOT.
The classical algorithms (SPOT and DSPOT) compute only upper threshold although
biSPOT and biDSPOT computes upper and lower thresholds.

## PYTHON3 DEPENDENCIES
The following packages are needed to run the algorithm

* `scipy`		[optimization]
* `numpy`		[array class]
* `pandas` 		[dataframe]
* `matplotlib` 	[plot]
* `tqdm`	[progress bar]

These libraries can be downloaded through pip3 :
`pip3 install scipy numpy pandas matplotlib tqdm --upgrade`
